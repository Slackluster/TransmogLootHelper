**AddOn version**
_For example v11.0.2-006_

**Have you tried to /reload, used /psl clear if it is recipe-related, and checked the issue occurs with only PSL enabled?**
_Preferably the answer to this question is yes._

**Have you taken a look at the addon's settings yet, to see if it's a feature that can be adjusted or disabled?**
_Again, the answer here is preferably yes._

**Describe the problem**
_What is going wrong? What should be happening? Is this reproducible, if yes, how?_
